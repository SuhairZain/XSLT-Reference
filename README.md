# XSLT Reference

This is a quick reference/cheatsheet for XSLT 1.0 elements and their attributes.

I'm building it for two main purposes:

1. For use with [Dash][DASH] on OS X - it's the perfect app for all sorts of API/reference lookups
2. To serve as a reference section on [Pimp My XSLT][PIMP] so I can easily point people to a
   URL that explains a specific element

[DASH]: http://kapeli.com/dash
[PIMP]: http://pimpmyxslt.com/
