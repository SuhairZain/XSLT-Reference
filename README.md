# XSLT Reference

This is a quick reference/cheatsheet for XSLT 1.0 elements and their attributes.

I'm building it for two main purposes:

1. For use with [Dash][DASH] on OS X - it's the perfect app for all sorts of API/reference lookups
2. To serve as a [reference section][XSLTREF] on [Pimp My XSLT][PIMP] so I can easily point people to a
   URL that explains a specific element

## Dev notes

I use [CodeKit][] for preprocessing the LESS file, and a simple bash script to transform the XML file with
the list of elements into a single HTML file. Yay, XSLT!
